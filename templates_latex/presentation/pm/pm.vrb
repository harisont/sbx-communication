\frametitle{Show max slide numbers}
For these slides, I used the option to
  show the maximum number of slides. To activate it
  one has to activate it with:
  \begin{verbatim}
    \usetheme[showmaxslides]{pureminimalistic}
  \end{verbatim}
  Usually, I prefer to not show the maximum number of
  slides, as the people tend to lose focus if they know
  the last few slides are shown.
